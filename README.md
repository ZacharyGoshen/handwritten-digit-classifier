# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

The MNIST data set is a library of 60,000 images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28 by 28 grayscale image of a digit 0 through 9. The data set is split into a training set of 50,000 images (5000 of each class) and a test set of 10,000 images (1000 of each class). *classifier.py* uses low level TensorFlow to create a three layer convolutional neural network that is able to correctly classify the test images with 97-98% accuracy.
